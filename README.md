# E19 home-dashboard

> Nuxt.js + Vuetify.js project

## Explanation

This is the sourcecode for a home-dashboard based on the home-assistant API. I display this dashboard on an wall-mounted iPad. The code is not yet generic on all places: I took some shortcuts specific to my needs... Also code quality needs to improve as well as error handling... Feel free though to use this code as basis for your own project! I will keep working on this dashboard and also post the relevant parts of my home-assistant configuration here later on.
